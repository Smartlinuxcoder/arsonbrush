## 11/28/2025 - Looking for components  

_Time spent: 4.5h_  

Heyo!
I wanna try making an electric toothbrush, I am reusing a perfectly fine dc motor I harvested from a dead Oral-b toothbrush.
I want to make both the toothbrush pcb and a base for it
Settled on the MSPM0C1104 microcontroller, DRV8833RTYR motor controller, MPU-6050 for the IMU, and the CN3058E for charging.
You might notice that I'm not using any regulator for my components, this is beacuse I am using a LiFePO4​ battery (voltage goes up to 3v6).
The base station will most probably house an esp32 and will connect to the brush via audio jack.
The cases will be designed in 3D and printed on my own printer I have at home.

## 12/21/2025 - Schematic done!  

_Time spent: 6.5h_

I made the schematic, switched out the MSPM0 for an STM32C0.
took a long time figuring out datasheets and pins to wire.
I have set the charging speed via a resistor to 300mA. that means that charging a 18650 will take ~10 hours.
I have added the brush button to a WAKE pin of the stm32 so I can make it go to sleep when not in use.
I have also made a rough sketch on Onshape for the sizes, it'll be roughly 16cm long and hopefully I will manage to house the pcb vertically, sandwiched between battery and case.

## 12/23/2025 - Routedmaxxed  

_Time spent: 10.0h_

Finished the schematic, added battery sensor functionality,and a bit more decoupling for the motors.
Fixed IMU caps to follow the datasheet.
Routed entire board, (with multiple iterations)

Made it all fit in 1.2cm of width! (same as an oral-b toothbrush, though I have A LOT more components)

  

## 12/26/2025 11 AM - Newer IMU!  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

I went to check the final price of the PCB, and it was over 80$ and I saw that a lot of money went to the MPU6050.
I looked at the other option and settled on the far better LSM6DSRTR, which reduced the total cost to a more sensible 60$.

On a sidenote, I also managed to find some nice Pogo pin connectors and a nice battery to add, but that's for another journal  

## 12/26/2025 10 PM - 3D model + base PCB!  

_Time spent: 5.0h_  

I added a grounded copper sheet sandwitched between the motor and the pcb, to reduce EMI and providing a nice, big, low impedance ground.
[I also chose the pogo pins to use, the base MCU, and the perfect battery.](https://github.com/Smartlinuxcoder/arsonbrush)
put all in a 3D model:

Added a case:

And this is done!

Now time for the base pcb:
I added the supermini, an oled screen I have lying around and a resistor+led for status

And routed it!
